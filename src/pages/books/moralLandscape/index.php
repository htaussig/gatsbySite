		<h3>The Book In 3 Sentences</h3>
		<p>
			The only thing good or better can refer to is human well-being, because anything good only matters in that it is good to someone or something
			</br></br>
			There is an increasing body of knowledge that leads us to learn things about the human mind and behavior which can help us know what practices, norms and cultures lead to human well-being
			</br></br>
			Therefore there are scientific facts that we can use to always get closer to about what makes a flourishing human individual and society and this is the only morality it makes sense to strive for.
		</p>

		<h3>Who Should Read It?</h3>
		<p>
			If you like to have your mind changed and think that morality can't be objective or think that religion is necessary for morality. 
			</br></br>
			If you want a deeper and clearer understanding of our own moral illusions.

		<h3>My Top 3 Quotes</h3>
		<p>
			"Clearly, people can adopt a form of life that needlessly undermines their physical health—as the average lifespan in many primitive societies is scarcely a third of what it has been in the developed world since the middle of the twentieth century. Why isn’t it equally obvious that an ignorant and isolated people might undermine their psychological well-being or that their social institutions could become engines of pointless cruelty, despair, and superstition?"

		</br></br>
		"Again, the concept of “health” is looser still: it, too, must be defined with reference to specific goals—not suffering chronic pain, not always vomiting, etc.—and these goals are continually changing. Our notion of “health” may one day be defined by goals that we cannot currently entertain with a straight face (like the goal of spontaneously regenerating a lost limb). Does this mean we can’t study health scientifically?"		</p>
	
		<h3>How the Book Changed Me</h3>
		<p>
			Completely changed my thoughts on cultural relativism. We know that honor killings and human sacrifice do not improve the well-being of humans, and we are causing suffering by being "tolerant" of these (and other) explicitly terrible cultural norms.
			</br></br>
			 		I felt before as if I had had inklings to these ideas, never sure of the idea whether morality could be objective, but this just brought extremely clear thinking to the subject, that makes me confident in contradicting my earlier mistakes
			</br></br> 
					If you can be confident that one way to go about things is morally superior to another, there is the basis there for encouraging another group or nation to change their practices.
			</br></br>
					Reinforced the idea that morality should work independent of who you are. Basically that those born in less fortunate situations were simply less fortunate than me, us both deserving of our situations in no way
			</br></br> 
					Clarifying the positive moral implications of breaking the illusion of free will and so trying to see even the criminal as a victim of his own genes, circumstances, and environment. If I had the same genes, circumstances and environment, could I really have acted differently?
